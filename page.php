                    For the past decade, Leirion has lived in the Near South Neighborhood with her husband Scott and their three children Ava, Turner, and Clio. She currently serves on the Lincoln and Lancaster County Planning Commission, the University of Nebraska Medical Center Chancellor's Board of Advisors, the Lincoln Public Schools Superintendent's Board of Advisors, and the Lincoln Community Foundation's Grant-making Committee. She has also served on the LPlan 2040 Advisory Committee, as a co-chair of Friendship Home's Keys of Hope annual campaign, and on the boards of Family Service, the Friends of the Pioneers Park Nature Center, and the Friends of the Lincoln Children's Museum.  
 
Leirion's first job after college was as a business analyst where she helped Fortune 500 companies become more efficient. She has also worked as a city budget and policy analyst and as a director of an after-school and summer academy for children from low-income communities.
 
She met her husband Scott, a lifelong Nebraskan, in college. They moved to Lincoln to raise a family after their first child, Ava, was born.
